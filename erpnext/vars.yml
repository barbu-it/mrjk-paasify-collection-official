# Default value is `$$host` which resolves site by host. For example, if your host is `example.com`,
# site's name should be `example.com`, or if host is `127.0.0.1` (local debugging), it should be `127.0.0.1`.
# This variable allows to override described behavior. Let's say you create site named `mysite`
# and do want to access it by `127.0.0.1` host. Than you would set this variable to `mysite`.
